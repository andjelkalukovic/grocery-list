This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About project
This Grocery list has Edit and Remove button for every item. If you want to edit the item, the button Submit changes the title into Edit.

The Clear Items button deletes all the items from the list. It is hidden when the list is empty. 

There is an alert after every single action (submitting, editing, deleting item or items) that disappears after three seconds.

The list will be saved at the local storage, so you will see it after refreshing the page.
